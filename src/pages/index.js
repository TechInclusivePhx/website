    <p>Working for a future where Phoenix’s tech community prizes inclusivity along with innovation. We are dedicated to fostering a diverse community of technologists and leaders, in which members of under-represented communities thrive. We empower participants through networking, mentoring, and education programs to explore technological careers and opportunities throughout the Valley.</p>
